# ‚úÖ PRISM TRADE - RAPID DEPLOYMENT FIXED

## üéØ WHAT I FIXED:

1. ‚úÖ Changed "WEALTH WARRIORS" ‚Üí "PRISM TRADE" in all pages
2. ‚úÖ Updated browser tab title to "PRISM TRADE"
3. ‚úÖ Created one-click deployment script

---

## üöÄ DEPLOY NOW - ONE COMMAND

Open PowerShell in the trading_platform folder and run:

```powershell
.\RAPID_DEPLOY.bat
```

This script will:
1. Rebuild React frontend with new branding
2. Commit all changes to git
3. Push to GitHub
4. Railway auto-deploys (2-3 minutes)

---

## üìç WHERE IS YOUR APP?

**IMPORTANT**: Tell me which URL you were looking at:

- **Local:** `http://localhost:5000` (running on your computer)
- **Deployed:** `https://prismtrade-production.up.railway.app` (live on internet)

If you were on **localhost**, you need to deploy to Railway for it to be live.

If you were on the **Railway URL**, just run the batch file and it'll update.

---

## ‚ö° AFTER DEPLOYMENT

Once Railway finishes deploying (check https://railway.app/dashboard):

Visit: `https://prismtrade-production.up.railway.app`

You should see:
- ‚úÖ "PRISM TRADE" header (not "WEALTH WARRIORS")
- ‚úÖ Login page with green theme
- ‚úÖ Dashboard after login
- ‚úÖ All stats showing correctly

---

## üîß IF GIT PUSH FAILS

If you get an error about git credentials:

```powershell
# Configure git if needed
git config --global user.name "Slidrive"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

# Then try again
.\RAPID_DEPLOY.bat
```

---

## üìã NEXT PHASE: LIVE TRADING UI

After branding is fixed, I'll build:

1. **API Keys Page** - Store Gemini API keys (encrypted)
2. **Trading Interface** - Manual buy/sell with real-time prices
3. **Position Dashboard** - View open trades with P&L
4. **Trade History** - Complete trade log

This is Phase 1 completion. Should take 30-60 minutes to build.

---

## ‚ùì TELL ME:

1. What URL were you looking at? (localhost or railway)
2. Do you have your Gemini API keys ready?
3. Ready to deploy now?
