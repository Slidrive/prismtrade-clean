# PRISMTRADE - COMPLETE DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## 🚨 CURRENT STATUS

**Frontend:** Built and ready (React with cyberpunk theme)
**Backend:** Running on Railway at `prismtrade-production.up.railway.app`
**Problem:** Frontend build directory doesn't exist yet - needs to be built first

## 🔧 WHAT YOU HAVE

Your frontend is complete with:
- ✅ Login/Register pages
- ✅ Dashboard with P&L stats, win rate, trade count
- ✅ Active strategies display
- ✅ Recent trades table
- ✅ Cyberpunk theme (dark bg, green/cyan accents)
- ✅ Strategy management
- ✅ API integration ready

Backend has:
- ✅ User auth (JWT)
- ✅ Strategy CRUD
- ✅ API key encryption
- ✅ Live trading endpoints (buy/sell/positions/history)
- ✅ CCXT integration for Gemini
- ✅ Trade history tracking

## 📋 BUILD & DEPLOY STEPS

### Step 1: Build Frontend Locally
```bash
cd C:\Users\skidr\Documents\trading_platform
.\build_complete.bat
```

This will:
1. Install npm dependencies
2. Build React app to `frontend/build/`
3. Verify Flask imports work

### Step 2: Test Locally
```bash
python app.py
```
Visit: `http://localhost:5000`
- Should show login page (not "8 words")
- API at `http://localhost:5000/api/*`

### Step 3: Deploy to Railway
```bash
.\deploy_to_railway.bat
```

This pushes to GitHub → Railway auto-deploys

### Step 4: Set Railway Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add:
```
SECRET_KEY=<generate-random-key>
PORT=5000
```

Generate SECRET_KEY:
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

## 🔍 WHAT WAS WRONG

**You said:** "8 words on the page and the wrong words"

**Problem:** The `frontend/build/` directory doesn't exist because the React app hasn't been built yet.

**Solution:** Run `build_complete.bat` to create the production build, then the Flask app will serve the actual dashboard instead of a blank/error page.

## 🏗️ DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE

```
Railway Deployment
├─ Install Python packages (requirements.txt)
├─ Install Node.js packages (npm ci)
├─ Build React app (npm run build)
│  └─ Creates: frontend/build/
│     ├─ index.html
│     ├─ static/js/
│     └─ static/css/
└─ Start Flask server
   ├─ Serves frontend/build/ at root /
   └─ API endpoints at /api/*
```

Flask route in `app.py`:
```python
@app.route('/', defaults={'path': ''})
@app.route('/<path:path>')
def serve(path):
    # Serves the React build
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "8 words on page"
**Cause:** No build directory
**Fix:** Run `build_complete.bat`

### "Cannot read properties of undefined"
**Cause:** Frontend calling wrong API URL
**Fix:** Check `frontend/.env.production` has `REACT_APP_API_URL=/api`

### "401 Unauthorized"
**Cause:** JWT token issues
**Fix:** Check SECRET_KEY in Railway env vars

### Railway build fails
**Cause:** npm/pip install errors
**Fix:** Check `railway.toml` and `nixpacks.toml` have correct commands

## 📁 KEY FILES

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app.py` | Flask backend + serves React |
| `frontend/build/` | **Production React build** (this was missing) |
| `frontend/.env` | Local dev API URL (localhost:5000) |
| `frontend/.env.production` | Production API URL (/api) |
| `railway.toml` | Railway build config |
| `nixpacks.toml` | Backup build config |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `build_complete.bat` | **Run this first** to build frontend |
| `deploy_to_railway.bat` | Deploy to Railway after build |

## ✅ CHECKLIST

Before deploying:
- [ ] Run `build_complete.bat` successfully
- [ ] Test locally with `python app.py`
- [ ] Verify frontend loads at `http://localhost:5000`
- [ ] Verify API works at `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- [ ] Commit all changes to git
- [ ] Push to GitHub with `deploy_to_railway.bat`
- [ ] Set SECRET_KEY in Railway dashboard
- [ ] Wait for Railway deployment
- [ ] Test production URL

## 🎯 EXPECTED RESULT

After deployment, visiting your Railway URL should show:

**Login Page** (if not logged in):
- Dark background (#0a0e27)
- Green accent color (#00ff41)
- Username/password inputs
- Login button

**Dashboard** (after login):
- "WEALTH WARRIORS" header
- Three stat cards: Total P&L, Win Rate, Total Trades
- Active strategies section
- Recent trades table
- Cyberpunk military theme

NOT "8 words" or a blank page.

## 🚀 PHASES

The blueprint shows 5 phases. You're currently in:

**Phase 1 (CURRENT):**
- ✅ User auth
- ✅ Strategy management
- ✅ API key encryption
- ✅ Live trading endpoints
- ⚠️ Frontend needs to be built

**Phase 2-5 (TODO):**
- Copy trading
- Leaderboard
- Prebuilt bots
- Gamification

First, get Phase 1 deployed and working, then we build the rest.
